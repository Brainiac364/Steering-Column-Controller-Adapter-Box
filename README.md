# Steering-Column-Controller-Adapter-Box
This project was designed to serve as an interface between the steering column controls on my 2002 Ford Focus SVT and my aftermarket Pioneer stereo.  The project's concept can be adapted and modified for use with most vehicles and stereos with a little research. 
This project depends on the Arduino SPI Library.  For more information on SPI visit: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/SPI
